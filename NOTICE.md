# Notices

RisuBard incorporates inherited GPLv3 code derived from RisuAI. Applicable original notices, copyright statements, repository history, and license terms remain preserved.

RisuBard changes and independently authored code:

## SQL storage lineage

The relational schema, typed adjacency-list value codec, SQLite commit model,
and browser OPFS backend are adapted from the user-supplied
`HaejeokRisuai-b6251` source tree. They have been reshaped around RisuBard's
PocketRisu-compatible `Database` contract and remain covered by this
repository's GPLv3 terms.

## Portable server dependency manifest

`scripts/portable/gen-server-deps.cjs` is adapted from the file of the same
name in PocketRisu (https://github.com/PocketRisu/PocketRisu), itself a fork of
RisuAI. PocketRisu is licensed GPL-3.0-only, as is this repository, so the port
is carried under this repository's GPLv3 terms. The file's own header records
the origin and the changes made for this tree.

## Bundled PageFold provider

`src/ts/builtin/pagefold-0.1.1-fix.js` is the user-supplied PageFold 0.1.1
provider bundle. The built-in wrapper preserves its version metadata and runs
it through the existing Risu plugin API v3 sandbox.

## Third-party icons

The workspace mode switch, character configuration navigation, and lorebook workspace use Solar Icons in the Bold style,
created by [480 Design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1166831539721848736).
The icons are licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
Their fill color and Svelte wrapper were adapted for RisuBard theming.
