# File-native user data

RisuBard stores canonical user data as ordinary JSON, JSONL, Markdown, and content-addressed files. SQLite and `database.bin` are not user-data authorities. A compatibility `database.bin` can be rebuilt for existing clients and RisuAI exports.

Set an absolute data root before starting the server:

```bash
RISUBARD_DATA_ROOT=/path/to/private/risubard-data node server/node/server.cjs
```

The root contains separate settings and credentials, stable-ID entity files, character/chat directories, appendable message JSONL, request/system JSONL logs, per-job state/events, assets, and BardWiki. Startup reads only small manifests; bodies load on demand.

Writes use a same-filesystem temporary file, fsync, checksum/schema validation, atomic rename, parent-directory fsync, `.bak` revisions, and a recoverable multi-file journal. Deletes move to `trash/`. User messages are fsynced before model requests, and streaming assistant drafts can be recovered.

Legacy `.bin` and save-folder imports support explicit merge or replace behavior. An old `risuai.db` is copied to `migration-backups/` before a one-time import; normal runtime has no SQLite dependency. Full backups include the canonical tree, assets, BardWiki, and compatibility export data.

On Termux, keep the data root in app-internal storage such as `$HOME/.local/share/risubard`. Shared `/sdcard` or `/storage/emulated` paths are rejected as canonical roots because they do not provide reliable fsync and atomic-rename semantics. Copy completed backup files there instead.
