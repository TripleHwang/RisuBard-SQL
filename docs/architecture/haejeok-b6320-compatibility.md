# HaejeokRisuAI b6320 compatibility baseline

RisuVault tracks HaejeokRisuAI `b6320` (`1260c9be`, 2026-08-25) as the current compatibility reference. The projects do not share Git history and their storage/runtime layers have diverged, so Haejeok commits are ported by behavior and regression test instead of being merged or used as binary updates.

## Integrated compatibility surface

- The local SQL schema remains `relational-schema-v3` / schema version 3. Unknown extension nodes are preserved instead of forcing a destructive migration.
- `.risu` loadout blocks and the latest root, character, module, and chat fields survive import, export, and SQL round trips.
- Module folders, additional-asset folder metadata, custom sidebar/loadout metadata, and per-chat global variable overrides are represented by the compatibility types.
- Sidebar toggle values can be scoped to the active chat while preserving valid empty-string and `0` values and falling back to the global value only when a local key is absent.
- The model selector supports search and persistent favorites without mutating the canonical model catalog. Gemini Flash 3.7 and both NovelAI Diffusion 5 variants are included.
- API v3 inlay access requires periodically reconfirmed permission. Already-installed API 2.1 plugins retain the legacy adapter for backward compatibility.
- RisuVault's existing durable model jobs, OPFS SQL backend, settings search, chat paging, and module organizer remain the canonical implementations where they already cover the corresponding Haejeok feature.

## Deliberate boundaries

Haejeok's Tauri installers, PostgreSQL deployment scripts, settings/persona visual redesign, and binary release channel are not copied wholesale. RisuVault is a standalone Node portable application with its own SQL lifecycle, branding, PageFold integration, release artifacts, and verified patch channel. UI changes are adopted only where they do not replace RisuBard-specific workspaces or break existing save/plugin compatibility.
